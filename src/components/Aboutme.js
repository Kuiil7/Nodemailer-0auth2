    In my experience, I always make things better.  My career began in Sales and Marketing with MCI WorldCom (now Verizon) while a college undergrad specializing in regards to telecommunications on a national scale. Through the years, I have worked as a contractor for Sorenson Video Relay Services, Z Video Relay Services, AT&T, and Gallaudet University. Most recently, I obtained my Master of Arts in linguistics and while there, it was when I realized that coding has always been my passion after working for 8 different units doing the same thing â€“ coding.
