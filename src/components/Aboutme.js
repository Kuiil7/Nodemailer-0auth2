    In my experience, I always make things better.  My career began in Sales and Marketing with MCI WorldCom (now Verizon) while a college undergrad specializing in regards to telecommunications on a national scale. Through the years, I have worked as a contractor for Sorenson Video Relay Services, Z Video Relay Services, AT&T, and Gallaudet University. In my recent position, I was responsible for maintaining company's content management system; Social Media Administrator, manage the Spanish aspect of our outreach efforts; responsible for print and online materials. 
In 2018, I obtained my Master of Arts in linguistics and while there, it was when I realized that coding has always been my passion after working for 8 different units doing the same thing – coding.
So here I am. A full stack developer ready to “make it better”.
